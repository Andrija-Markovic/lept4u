This is a proof of concept project which represents a Java implementation of 
[Leptonica](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica).

I opened a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/issues/644) on Leptonica's repo
and learned some interesting information.

### There exists a [Python wrapper library for Leptonica](https://pypi.org/project/pyleptonica/)
